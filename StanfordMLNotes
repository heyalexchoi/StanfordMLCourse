ML

supervised learning
regression - continuous output - project sales over next 3 months
categorization - discrete output - malignant or benign tumor

unsupervised learning
clustering - dump huge data set of genes on a bunch of people - group them for me.

Cost Function
Hypothesis = param0 + param1(x)
Generate hypothesis function trying different params

Find parameters to make hypothesis function look more like the training data's results.

Objective function for linear regression:
Find parameters to "minimize" sum of squares of difference between hypothesis result h(x) and training data y.

cost function = squared error cost function

(1/2) * m * summation(1, m, function(i){ (hx(i) - y(i)) ** 2 })

most commonly used for regression problems
